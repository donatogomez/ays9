# AYS Repositories

AYS repositories (repos) are Git repositories containing services and actor templates.

These are the two types of repositories used by AYS:

- **AYS Template Repos** are Git repositories containing all actor templates from which an actual AYS instance can be deployed. We can see it as a library of services form which you pick some templates to represent what you're trying to model.

  - See [AYS template repo](../FileDetails/AYS-template-repo.md) for more details

- **AYS Repos** are Git repositories containing actually deployed instances

  - See [AYS repo](../FileDetails/AYS-repo.md) for more details
