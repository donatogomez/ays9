# What's new in AYS v8.2?
- No more HRD: HRD format has been completly removed from AYS.
It has been replaced by yaml for actor template Configuration and capnp for schema definition.
- In this version we have merge the AYS daemon and API together. Which means you only have one running process that serve everything.


## AsyncIO
We have replaced to usage of Multiprocessing with asyncio.
